## 4. 📂 File Changes & Technical Details
(Fill out this table summarizing the files touched).

| File Name | Description of Changes | Functions/Classes Added, Modified, or Removed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `src/Graph.cpp` | Added DFS traversal logic | `DFS()`, `isVisited()` |
| `include/Node.h` | Updated struct for doubly linked list | `Node* prev`, `Node* next` |
| `tests/SortTest.cpp` | Added test cases for null arrays | `testEmptyArray()` |

## 5. 👨‍🏫 DSA TA Review (The Grading Criteria)
(Critique the code based on 2nd-year CS standards).

* **Algorithmic Complexity:**
    * Identify the **Time Complexity** (Big O) of the main functions added.
    * Identify the **Space Complexity**.
    * *Warning:* Flag any $O(n^2)$ or $O(n!)$ operations inside loops that could be optimized to $O(n \log n)$ or $O(n)$.
* **Data Structure Usage:**
    * Are they using the right data structure for the job? (e.g., Using a `vector` when a `HashSet` would make lookups faster).
* **Code Quality & Style:**
    * Check for "Magic Numbers".
    * Check for variable naming (e.g., flag variables named `x`, `temp`, `a` unless they are simple loop counters).
    * Check for comments explaining *complex* logic (but flag redundant comments).
* **Edge Cases & Safety:**
    * Check for handling of: `null` pointers, empty lists/arrays, out-of-bounds indices.
    * (If C/C++) Check for memory management (Are `delete` or destructors called?).
